After being repeatedly denied a promotion despite his hard work, he takes a drastic risk—embezzling funds from his bank. He dives into the shady world of illegal stock investments and money laundering, teaming up with a powerful stock broker inspired by figures like Harshad Mehta. As wealth pours in, Bhaskar’s life spirals: his marriage with Sumathi (played by Meenakshi Chaudhary) strains, and eventually, the CBI zeroes in on his scams. He must navigate betrayal, guilt, and legal peril to attempt redemption and accountability by the film’s climax.</p> -->
